# kwar_tools

Tools to work with ancient files of the time.

# Installation

Just try to run the scripts and install missing packages with `pip`. (TODO: add requirements.txt)

# Usage

Run the script for the file format you want to unpack.

Note that mesh files such as `.kwsm`, `.kwam` and `.kwsk` require the corresponding `.kwtx` files to be unpacked first.

Unpacking `.kwan` files requires the corresponding `.kwsk` file.
